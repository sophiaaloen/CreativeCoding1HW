GUI vs CLI
Graphical User Interface requires very little knowledge of the basic functions of a computer to be able to use it. It is a visual representation of folders and whatever files are stored within them. Folders and files each have their own icons that can be moved by clicking and dragging with your mouse, or by left clicking and selecting ‘move’ to find the new location for the file or secondary folder. Command Line Interface is a bit more complicated. Within CLI, folders are considered directories, but files remain the same. Regardless of name, they all serve the same function. CLI, however, requires basic knowledge of directories, directory functions, and various shortenings of words or alternative combinations that allow a command line to function. With CLI, you can create, search, and open all files without switching tabs or search areas. You can find files faster and more efficiently than with a GUI. You can also create files, rename them, and move them to new directories within just a few seconds. The use of CLI also allows a user to get more complicated with the use of commands, allowing them to even open specific websites directly from the command center or terminal.
