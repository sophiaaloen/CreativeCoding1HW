Before watching this lecture, I was confused by the title. However, within the first two minutes the question was answered: this was the last lecture he would be able to give. As a concept, I was saddened by it but his personality, his energy, and his continued enthusiasm about the remainder of his life brought the mood back up for the rest of the lecture. One of the things that I found the most interesting was his discussion on virtual reality in 1991. I personally had no idea that virtual reality was even conceptualized as a possibility as far back as 1991, so hearing and seeing that it had been done and for only $5,000 when the usual price to run a virtual reality simulation was almost half a million dollars was both shocking and eye opening as to what you can do even when you’re on a slim budget. The main content of his lecture though was childhood dreams; how he achieved his and how he enabled others dreams. Through his career as a professor he did both. He was able to experience zero gravity, and then he worked as a pseudo disney imagineer through virtual reality. He helped other achieve their dreams; a student of his wanted to work on the Star Wars films, so he used his teaching of virtual reality concepts which eventually led to that student working on the next three star wars movies.
