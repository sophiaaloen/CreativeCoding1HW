You are a Visual learner!
When it comes to learning styles, I’m not sure that it actually affects how we learn. I think that there are certainly negatives and positives to each style, and how a person varies them, but personally I don’t know that there’s a difference in my absorption of knowledge based on which one I use. In taking the quiz, I got the result of a visual learner. I agree with this; I find that I most enjoy learning when it is something that is visually displayed to me or shown to me before I do it. I prefer to learn this way. However, I think that I absorb the same knowledge if I were to use auditory or tactile learning.
The traits of a visual learner are: “neat and clean, visualization of concepts, closing your eyes for recollection, seeking visual stimuli, may struggle with spoken directions,” etc. And I have found that these are all things that I do regularly when learning on my own or in a class. I also struggle with a lot of the described common struggles of visual learners. But at the same time, I feel as though I carry a lot of traits of a tactile learner and in the results of the quiz, each learning style is almost equal.
In the article regarding learning styles, May writes, “Although students believe that learning preferences influence performance, this research affirms the mounting evidence that they do not.” And I agree. I have not found that my learning is affected by how they prefer to learn and I think a lot of that is not by choice, but by necessity. From an early age, public schools use a blend of all three, and over time I think that students adapt to being able to learn through any style, because they have no choice in how the information is presented to them. If a professor gives a lecture, they have no choice but to learn from auditory information only. Alternatively, if you are taking an online course, a professor might post a slideshow visualizing the information. Or if you are taking a lab course, tactile work is necessary to perform experiments.
